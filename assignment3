Approach:

- check the port status 
command:
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN

- If port is already listening, then  we should check the services whether it is over ClusterIP or NodePort.
command: 
kubectl get svc


- If type ClusterIP, then we change it to NodePort 
command:
kubectl edit service #servicename

-if not working ,we delete all the old pods and services and apply the replicaSet .yaml
so that it will create the services again.

command:
kubectl apply -f replicaSet.yaml

- we will run the application. If it still fails to run then the last option is to change the port in replicaSet.yaml
