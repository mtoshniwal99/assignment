In this case we will use rolling update.
It is the gradual process that allows to update application with some changes and no downtime.
The previous pod is taken down and the updated one is deployed.
The newly deployed application will have next version than previous application


$kubectl patch deployment kubia -p '{"spec": {"minReadySeconds": xxx}}'
 then we will perform set image command so it will update to this image in the update

$set image deployment xxx
then it will gradually change from previous version to new version
